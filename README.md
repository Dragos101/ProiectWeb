# Wade project

# Name of project: Migration Reporting Tool

Description: Considering observations provided by users (<em>e.g.</em>, messages posted on a social network) or various sensors, develop an "intelligent"
Web system capable to generate in real-time <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Develop" title="Details">an interactive map</a> regarding the migrations performed by various entities (birds, humans, robots, extraterrestrial beings) in a specific context (season, working, politic factors, calamity). A migration-related event could be directly reported – in conjunction to the GPS info + optional (meta)data – into the implemented platform or by using <code>#mig-here</code> hashtag on an existing social Web application (Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo). Several useful statistics and visualizations about the migratory habits of specific species – including information on <a href="http://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html" title="Details about GeoNames">geographical areas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets#climate-weather" title="Climate/Weather data sources">climate</a>, seasons, user comments/images/videos, etc. – should be offered by a SPARQL endpoint – possibly enhanced by additional knowledge provided by DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Visit also <a href="https://www.migrationdataportal.org/" title="Migration Data Portal">Migration Data Portal</a>. Bonus: adopting a <a href="https://manuzhang.github.io/awesome-streaming/" title="Resources of interest">stream processing</a> approach.</p>
