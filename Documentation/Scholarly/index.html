      Migration Reporting Tool is a web-based utility. Designed as a solution for visualizing, editing, and reporting migration data processes, the tool integrates user observations and data from various sensors to generate, in real-time, an interactive map depicting migrations conducted by different entities. 
    </p>
  </section>

  <section typeof="schema:Article" property="schema: articleSection" id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
    <h2><span>2. </span>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Migration Reporting Tool (MIR) is a project proposed at <span typeof="schema:Course" property="schema:url" resource="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/wade/"><a role="doc-biblioref" href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/wade/"><span property="schema:name">Web Application Development course</span></a></span>. In order to resolve this task, the REST paradigm will be used. The communication between the server and the clients will be resolved by creating an REST API that will handle the desired comunnication in our web application.The migrations will be shown on an interactive map and they will be handled in different ways by the users, regarding the role of the client. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>UPDATE:</strong> The site can be tested <a href = "https://migrationreportingtool.web.app/">here</a> and a demo can be visualised <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA7DYzfgNrM&ab_channel=DragosBaciu">here.</a>
    </p>

  </section>

  <section typeof="schema:Article" property="schema:articleSection" id="motivation" role="doc-motivation">
    <h2><span>3. </span>Motivation</h2>
    We opt for this project because it is an interisting problem in real life, regarding some situations: firstly, such a tool will be useful to see how Romanians go abroad because of the financial situation. Then, we taught about the migrations that took place because of the wars. Finally, we can see the impact of such an application when we want to track how birds or some species of animals migrates because of the weather/ climate changes.

  <section typeof="schema:Article" property="schema:articleSection" id="functionalities" role="doc-functionalities">
    <h2><span>4. </span>Functionalities</h2>
    <section id="internal-data">
      <h3><span>4.1 </span>Internal Data</h3>
      <p>
        The internal data structures and models chosen for MIR will be designed to efficiently store and manage migration data. In this context, we think about the following models:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Migration Object Model</li>
        <li>User Role-Based Model</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the context diagram, we want to show this type of hadling. In the below diagram, we show that we will divide the data into two main components: users and migrations (see the databases).
      </p>
      <img src="../Diagrams/C1_Diagrama_MIR.png" alt="C4-Context-Diagram-of-MIR" style="width: 100%">
      <p>
        In the containers diagram, we focused on the interaction of clients, regarding their status (user or guest), in order to show the desired behaviour for our web application.
      </p>
      <img src="../Diagrams/ContainersDiagramMIR.png" alt="C4-Context-Diagram-of-MIR" style="width: 100%">
      <p>
        As seen in the diagrams above we'll be having the following functionalities an user can interact with throughout our website:
        <ul>
          <ol>
            <li>Login</li>
            <li>Register</li>
            <li>Create a new migration</li>
            <li>Update a migration</li>
            <li>Delete a migration</li>
            <li>See a migration in details</li>
            <li>See a list of migrations</li>
            <li>Interact with an inteligent map that displays migrations</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early stage of building the architecture with MIR, we have thought that the following models will suit perfectly the needs for our models:
        <ul>
          <ol>
            <li>User</li>
            <img src="swagger-models/user.png" alt="User-Model" style="width: 100%">
            <li>Migration</li>
            <img src="swagger-models/migration.png" alt="Migration-Model" style="width: 100%">
            <li>MigrationType</li>
            <img src="swagger-models/migration-type.png" alt="Migration-Type-Model" style="width: 100%">
            <li>MigrationContext</li>
            <img src="swagger-models/migration-context.png" alt="Migration-Context-Model" style="width: 100%">
            <li>MigrationLocation</li>
            <img src="swagger-models/migrationLocation.png" alt="Migration-Location-Model" style="width: 100%">
          </ol>
        </ul>

        Update: Models have suffered some modification as follows in the following pictures:
        <ul>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>MigrationContext</li>
            <img src="swagger-models/migrationContext-update.png" alt="Migration-Context-Update" style="width: 100%;">

    </section>
    <section id="external-data">
      <h3>4.2. External Data Sources</h3>
      <p>
        MIR will use  external data sources such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Migration Data API - that will help us in managing the functionalities</li>
        <li>Geolocation Services - that will help us in showing the migrations on a map</li>
        The interactive map will be implemented using <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> since it fits all criterias we are looking for.
        <li>Stardog API</li>
        This API is instrumental in managing core functionalities within MIR, such as updating, retrieving, and analyzing migration data. It serves as a crucial backbone for our data management strategy, ensuring that our repository remains up-to-date and accurate. Stardog has all the tools necessarry to upload a rdf schema, more than that, we could just create an endpoint to which our application could connect and make the necessarry API calls such: creating a migration, gathering all the migrations for a specific user and so on. All of these are possible thanks to a SPARQL endpoint implementation.
        <li>AWS s3 API</li>
        This API allows a user to upload a photo to the S3 bucket. The project doens't implement a secure way to communicate with the bucket, since the implementation shows the access key and the secret key. But, other than that, thanks to this we can make use of photos.
        <li>Location Data</li>
        Thanks to some databases we could figure out a way to download a file which contains all the countries with their cities, along with that we have longitute and latitute for every city on the Earth. We make use of this information when we create or update a migration, but not only that, also when we compute migrations for the interactive map. 
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="linked-data">
      <h3>4.3 Conforming with linked data principles</h3>
      <p>
        The solution implemented in MIR will use linked data principles, ensuring data interoperability and accessibility. For our project, we think at these possible solutions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usage of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for data identification</li>
        <li>Linking data elements through RDF (Resource Description Framework)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have proposed the following models for using RDFs:</p>
      <ul>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Ontology IRI</li>
          We we're looking for something meaningful, clear and sugestive, and we've choosen: http://www.semanticweb.org/web-proj/MIR as for our IRI
          <li>Class</li>
          We have the following classes:
          <ul>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Migration</li>
              <li>MigrationType</li>
              <li>MigrationLocation</li>
              <li>MigrationContext</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
          These classes model the way we store the RDF.
          <li>Object Properties - Relationships</li>
          <ul>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>hasType</li>
              Is the property of a migration that ensures a Migration must have a MigrationType.
              <li>hasLocation</li>
              Is the property of a migration that ensures a Migration must have a MigrationLocation.
              <li>hasContext</li>
              Is the property of a migration that ensures a Migration must have a MigrationContext.
            </ol>
          </ul>
          <li>Attributes</li>
          <ul>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Migration attributes</li>
              Migration class has the following attributes: id, userId, migrationLocationId, migrationContextId, migrationTypeId; where id is a unique identifier, userId is the link between the user that created the migration and migration, migrationLocationId is the link between the migrationLocation and migration, migrationContextId is the link between the migrationContext and migration and migrationTypeId is the link between migrationLocation and migration.
              <li>MigrationLocation attributes</li>
              MigrationLocation has the following attributes: id, country, city, longitude, latitude; where id is the unique identifier, country states the country of the migration, city states the city of the migration, longitude and latitude being the fields populated when both country and city have been selected.
              <li>MigrationType attributes</li>
              MigrationType has the following attributes: id, category; where id is the unique identifier and the category is useful for labeling a migration.
              <li>MigrationContext attributes</li>
              MigrationContext attributes has the following attributes: id, working, thumbnailUrl, season, politicFactors, name, description, calamity. All of them are attributes that put label on our migration.

    <h2><span>6. </span>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion, the Migration Reporting Tool (MIR) represents a comprehensive solution for visualizing, managing, and reporting migration data processes. Throughout the development of this web-based utility, we have carefully considered various aspects, ranging from internal data structures to external data sources and adhering to linked data principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functionalities of MIR cover a broad spectrum, including user authentication, CRUD operations on migrations, and interaction with an intelligent map. We have designed internal data models, employed external data sources, and ensured adherence to linked data principles for improved data interoperability and accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incorporation of ontologies within the Migration Reporting Tool (MIR) marks a pivotal aspect of our project, contributing significantly to the overall structure, understanding, and interoperability of migration data. Through careful consideration and application of linked data principles, our ontologies provide a standardized and semantically rich framework for representing various entities and relationships within the system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Structured Data:</strong> The ontologies, identified by the chosen Ontology IRI (http://www.semanticweb.org/web-proj/MIR), ensure structured and organized data representation. Classes such as Migration, MigrationType, MigrationLocation, and MigrationContext delineate the distinct components of migration data, enhancing clarity and maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interconnected Relationships:</strong> Object properties like <code>hasType</code>, <code>hasLocation</code>, and <code>hasContext</code> establish interconnected relationships, reflecting the dependencies and associations between different elements. This not only aids in comprehensive data modeling but also fosters better understanding of migration processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Attributes and Semantic Enrichment:</strong> The attributes associated with each class provide a granular level of detail, enriching the semantics of the data. This semantic richness not only enhances the user experience but also facilitates seamless integration with external data sources, contributing to a more holistic view of migration phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      The collaboration process has been facilitated through GitHub, where we collaboratively created diagrams, developed the OpenAPI specification, implemented Scholarly HTML, and tracked project progress. The deployment of the application using Microsoft Azure, for backend, and Firebase, for frontend, adds a practical dimension to our efforts.
